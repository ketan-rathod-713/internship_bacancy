# Each of the 5 allocations will be using a different dynamic port. While it is possible to query Nomad to obtain these ports, it can become somewhat laborious, so letâ€™s look at an easier way to access our application.

# we need a way to run consul and need to register http-echo application in catalog.
# we can solve both this problem using nomad.
# schedule consul in nomad to run natively, rather then using container in docker engine, raw_exec will run a task in the same OS as nomad is runnning  in.
