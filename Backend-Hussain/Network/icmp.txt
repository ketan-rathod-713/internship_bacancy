ICMP

some firewalls block icmp for security reasons.
That is why ping might not work in those cases
disabling icmp also can cause real damage with connection establishment
- fragmentation needed
PING demo

ping is nothing but just icmp message comes.

How ping works ?

it sends icmp echo request from this to destination router.

destination if know icmp protocol then it will send the reply.

if in between entire route if ttl becomes 0 then that router will send an icmp message of unreachable stuff ig.


Traceroute
can you identify the entire path your ip packet takes ?
clever use of ttl
increment ttl slowly and you will get router ip address for each hop
doesnt always work as path changes and icmp might be blocked.

traceroute is not 100% correct always.
