// grpc
// request response arch is not scallable
// one way to scale is to use remote procedure calls
// directly call functions from client to server
// instead of JSON, user protobuf.
// size of payload is small hence fast communication.

// use cases
// microservices, bloackchaings peers interactions :D

// graphql need to be learned
